Cloud Economics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Capitalized Expenditure (Capex): When building a data center, organization invest in upfront cost for building, servers and supporting equipments.
=> Operating Expenditure (Opex): Regular day to day expenses for data center, ongoing connectivity, utility and maintenance cost

	- Manage your own data center                  |        Cloud Infrastructure
		- Large upfront cost (Capex)						- No Upfront cost (Only Opex)
		- Unused capacity or unmet capacity                 - you pay as you go
		- Increasing capacity and needs more				- Capacity scales to meet user demand
			investment.
		- Monthly cost will map to predicted				- Monthly cost will map to user demand
			infrastructure cost
			
			
=> Organize and Optimize AWS cost

	AWS Cost explorer:
		- Provides UI for exploring AWS costs.
		- Provides breakdown by : service and cost tags
		- Provides prediction for next 3 months.
		- Gives recomendation for cost optimization.
		
	AWS Budget: 
		- Provides the max budget you want to spend on specific services like EC2 max budget, etc.
		
	AWS Cost planning tools:
		1)AWS TCO calculator: Determines what could be saved by liveraging cloud infrastructure.
		2)AWS Simple monthly calculator: Cost of running specific cloud infrastructure.
		
	AWS Resource Tags: 
		- Metadata assigned to specific AWS resource.
		- Includes a name and an optional value.
		- Common use case includes department, environment or project
		
	AWS Organization: 
		- Allows organization to manage multiple accounts under single master account.
		- Ability to leverage consolidated billings for all accounts.
		- Common security implementation and logging across all accounts.
		
=> AWS TCO Calculator (Total Cost of Ownership)
		- awstcocalculator.com
		- This utility provide an in depth comparison of the cost that organization needs to pay for physical data center vs cloud infrastructure
			in AWS
		- You can view those and in depth comparison and download a detailed report made by AWS.
		- AWS make this report based on your requirement plus its own assumptions and recomendation.
		
=> AWS simple monthly calculator (deprecated)
=> AWS Pricing calculator
	- calculator.aws
	- Here you can select a type of service you need for your requirement like db service, ec2 or other and AWS will provide an estimated budget	
		and recommend the already exist service options for the same like 32 gb ram, 512gb ssd, etc for ec2 it will suggest to go far large
		ubantu ec2.
		
=> Cost Explorer
	- Here we can get details of ongoing cost of the aws infra you are using also it provides the forecasted cost.
	- We can get a detail of the monthly cost or daily cost.
	- we can see cost associated with different services used
	- we can see cost associated with different accounts linked to its master accounts
